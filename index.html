<p>pyTalkManager is a program to aid public talk coordinators in the
congregations of Jehovah's Witness. It is written in
<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python3</a> and uses the
<a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt</a> GUI framework
(<a href="http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide">PySide</a>) and
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for its database, all of which are
open source and cross platform technologies. Visit the project's
<a href="https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki">wiki</a> for more
information.</p>

<h2>
<a id="development" class="anchor" href="#development" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Development</h2>

<p>pyTalkManager is only now starting to be developed. At the moment I am
in the designing phase and do not expect to have pyTalkManager ready
for quite some time. Check back every few weeks to keep an eye on the
progress.</p>

<h2>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>Visit the
<a href="https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki/installation">installation section</a>
in our wiki for installation instructions.</p>

<h2>
<a id="open-source" class="anchor" href="#open-source" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Source</h2>

<p>pyTalkManager is being developed under an open source software
model. I would like to take the time to explain what exactly that
means and how it benefits you as a user.</p>

<h3>
<a id="open-source-and-free-software" class="anchor" href="#open-source-and-free-software" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Source and Free Software</h3>

<p>Computer applications are made with something called a <em>source
code</em>. The source code is the written instructions the application
uses to run on your computer. An analogy can be made with baking. If a
cake were to be baked, the baker would have to follow a set of
instructions, a recipe, in order to bake their delicious cake. It can
be said that the recipe is the cake's <em>source code</em>.</p>

<p>Say you love the cake and you have a few ideas to improve upon on it,
say you want to add raisins, or perhaps bake a smaller version of the
cake to fit in lunch boxes. Maybe you are allergic to nuts and need to
know if the cake contains nuts. Well, if the baker keeps his recipe
secret then any of those options are out of your hands.</p>

<p><a href="http://opensource.org/">Open source software</a>/<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free software</a>
refers to software in which its source code, or <em>recipe</em>, is made
public for anyone to view, modify, and share. Perhaps you would like
to add a new feature or fix a bug. This is only possible if the
project is open source.</p>

<h3>
<a id="benefits" class="anchor" href="#benefits" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Benefits</h3>

<p>Using an open source model has benefits to the project and also to
you, the end user.</p>

<h4>
<a id="the-project" class="anchor" href="#the-project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Project</h4>

<p>An open source model allows many people to take a part in the
project's development. Perhaps one person can help by fixing a bug in
the software, another person may help in the design of the GUI,
Graphical User Interface, while someone else may assist with improving
the database or translate pyTalkManager.</p>

<p>Also, the responsibility of building and maintaining the project
doesn't fall on the shoulders of one or two individuals. By having
many eyes reviewing and contributing to the project everyone can have
a hand in the building of pyTalkManager.</p>

<h4>
<a id="the-end-user-you" class="anchor" href="#the-end-user-you" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The End-User (You)</h4>

<p>The benefits of using an open source model isn't only for the
project's development but also for its users as well.</p>

<p>More often than not, when you use closed source software, your data is
locked into the program you are using. For example, say you use a
popular talk manager for your congregation but then you decide to
migrate to another program. You will not be able to because the author
of said program hasn't disclosed how the data is stored. Further more,
the data may not be user accessible. You are effectively locked into
the program.</p>

<p>With open software everything is documented. Data is not stored in a
way that locks it into the application.</p>

<p>Also, say you have a feature that you would like to see implemented
but the developer of the project doesn't know how or doesn't want to
spend the time in implementing it. In an open source project, anyone
can implement your feature without relaying on the project's
manager(s) having to do the work. This means the project has the
penitential of gaining features faster than closed sourced projects.</p>

<p>It is also important to consider the fact that the developer of a
project may disappear and stop developing the program you rely on. In
an open source project if that were to happen, anyone can take the
source code and continue to develop the project under a new name. This
is called forking. This is what happened to the
<a href="http://www.OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> project. Many people felt
the project wasn't moving in the right direction and were unhappy with
the state of OpenOffice.org. They took action and forked project.
<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> is now a much better
office suite than OpenOffice.org has ever been.</p>

<p>More over, what if you love pyTalkManager but wish there were an
Android and/or iPhone app that can import the pyTalkManager's
database? Since pyTalkManager and its tools are open sourced, creating
such app isn't only possible but not difficult.</p>

<p>Perhaps you don't like pyTalkManager and decide to build another
application. Create your application and import pyTalkManager's
database so that your data can be used. It's very simple.</p>

<p>This and more is all possible with open source software.</p>
