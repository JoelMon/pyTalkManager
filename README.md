# pyTalkManager

pyTalkManager is a program to aid public talk coordinators in the
congregations of Jehovah's Witness. It is written in
[Python3](https://www.python.org/) and uses the
[Qt](http://qt-project.org/) GUI framework
([PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)) and
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for its database, all of which are
open source and cross platform technologies. Visit the project's
[wiki](https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki) for more
information.

##Development

pyTalkManager is only now starting to be developed. At the moment I am
in the designing phase and do not expect to have pyTalkManager ready
for quite some time. Check back every few weeks to keep an eye on the
progress.


##Installation

Visit the
[installation section](https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki/installation)
in our wiki for installation instructions.


##Open Source

pyTalkManager is being developed under an open source software
model. I would like to take the time to explain what exactly that
means and how it benefits you as a user.


###Open Source and Free Software

Computer applications are made with something called a *source
code*. The source code is the written instructions the application
uses to run on your computer. An analogy can be made with baking. If a
cake were to be baked, the baker would have to follow a set of
instructions, a recipe, in order to bake their delicious cake. It can
be said that the *recipe* is the cake's source code.

Say you love the cake but you had a few ideas to improve upon on it,
say you want to add raisins, or perhaps bake a smaller version of the
cake to fit in your lunch box. Maybe you are allergic to nuts and need
to know if the cake contains nuts. Well, if the baker keeps his recipe
secret then you are unable to bake the cake your self.

[Open source software](http://opensource.org/)/[Free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
refers to software in which its source code, or *recipe*, is made
public for anyone to view. Also, anyone has the right to download the
source code and make or modify the application. Perhaps you would like
to add a new feature or fix a bug.


###Benefits

Using an open source model has many benefits to the project and also
to you, the end user.


####The Project

An open source model allows many people to take a part in the
project's development. Perhaps one person can help by fixing a bug in
the software, another person may help in the design of the GUI,
Graphical User Interface, while someone else may assist with improving
the database used by pyTalkManager.

The responsibility to build and maintain the project doesn't fall on
the shoulders of one or two individuals. By having many eyes reviewing
and contributing to the project we can all have a hand in the building
of pyTalkManager.


####The End-User (You)

The benefits of using an open source model isn't only for the
project's development but also for its users as well.

More often than not, when you use closed source software, your data
gets locked into the program you are using. For example, say you use a
popular talk manager for your congregation but then you decide to
migrate the data to another program. You will not be able to because
the author of said program hasn't disclosed how the data is
stored. Further more, the data may not be user accessible. You are
effectively locked into the program.

With open software everything is documented. Data is not stored in a
way that locks it into the application. 

Also, say you have a feature that you would like to see implemented
but the developer of the project doesn't know how or doesn't want to
spend the time in implementing it. In an open source project, anyone
can implement your feature without relaying on the project's
manager(s) having to do the work. This means the project has the
penitential of gaining features faster than closed sourced projects.

It is also important to consider the fact that the developers of a
project may disappear and stop developing the program you rely on. In
an open source project if that were to happen, anyone can take the
source code and continue to develop the project under a new name. This
is called forking. This is what happened to the
[OpenOffice.org](OpenOffice.org) project. Many people felt the project
wasn't moving in the right direction and forked the
project. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) is now a much
better office suite than OpenOffice.org has ever been.

More over, what if you love pyTalkManager but wish there were an
Android and/or iPhone app that can import the pyTalkManager's
database? Since pyTalkManager and tools it uses are open sourced,
creating such app isn't only possible but not difficult.

Perhaps you don't like pyTalkManager and decide to build another
application. Create your application and import pyTalkManager's
database so that your data can be used.

This and more is all possible with open source software.
