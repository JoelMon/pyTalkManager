# pyTalkManager

**pyTalkManager** is a program to aid public talk coordinators, PTC,
in the congregations of Jehovah's Witness. It is written in
[Python3](https://www.python.org/) and uses the
[Qt](http://qt-project.org/) GUI framework
([PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)) and
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for its database, all of which are
open source and cross platform technologies. Visit the project's
[wiki](https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki) for more
information.

**pyTalkManager** differentiates its self from other PTC software in a
number of ways. For one, it is an open source project. Also,
**pyTalkManager** will not be sold or have features that will only be
unlocked with *donations*. Since **pyTalkManager** is open source and
uses a flexible license, other PTC software developers can create
programs that interact with **pyTalkManager**.
