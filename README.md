pyTalkManager
=============

pyTalkManager is a program to aid public talk coordinators in the
congregations of Jehovah's Witness. It is written in Python3 and uses
the QT GUI framework (PySide) and SQLite, all of which is open source
technologies.

Development
===========

pyTalkManager is only starting to be developed. At the moment I am
in the designing phase and do not expect to have pyTalkManager ready
for quite some time. You should check back every few months to keep an
eye on its progress if the project interests you.

Open Source
===========

I have decided to create pyTalkManager as an open source project. By
using an open source model, features and bug fixes can be submitted by anyone
who is willing to help. Furthermore, if the project becomes stagnate,
others may take the source code of pyTalkManager and continue its
development. This is in stark contrast to how programs for talk
coordinators have been developed in the past and it is my opinion that developing
these important programs with a open source model is both more
productive and beneficial for the end user.

Not sure what open source software means? The following video gives a basic
overview of how open source software

Dependencies
============

There is only one dependency that is not included in the Python3.X
Standard Library which must be installed.

* [pySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide) - pySide is used as the
  user interface framework and must be installed on your system for
  pyTalkmanager to run. pySide can be downloaded from [here]
  (http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:LanguageBindings::PySide::Downloads).
