pyTalkManager
=============
    pyTalkManager is a program to aid public talk coordinators at Kingdom halls of Jehovah Witness.
it is written in Python3 and uses the QT GUI framework (PySide) and SQLite, all of which is open
source technologies.

Development
===========
    pyTalkManager is only starting to be developed. At the moment I am in the designing phase and
do not expect to have pyTalkManager ready for quite some time. You should check back every few months
to keep an eye on its progress if the project interests you.

Open Source
===========
    I have decided to create pyTalkManager as an open source project.
