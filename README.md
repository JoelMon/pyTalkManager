pyTalkManager
=============

pyTalkManager is a program to aid public talk coordinators in the
congregations of Jehovah's Witness. It is written in
[Python3](https://www.python.org/) and uses the
[Qt](http://qt-project.org/) GUI framework
([PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)) and
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for its database, all of which are
open source and cross platform technologies.

Development
===========

pyTalkManager is only now starting to be developed. At the moment I am
in the designing phase and do not expect to have pyTalkManager ready
for quite some time. Check back every few weeks to keep an eye on the
progress.

Open Source
===========

I have decided to create pyTalkManager as an open source project. By
using an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)
model, features and bug fixes can be submitted by anyone who is
willing to help. Furthermore, if the project becomes stagnate, others
may take the source code of pyTalkManager and continue its
development. This is in stark contrast to how programs for talk
coordinators have been developed in the past and it is my opinion that
developing these important programs with an open source model is both
productive and beneficial for the end user.

Not sure what open source software means? The following video gives a
basic overview of the open source
model. [Open Source Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyd0FO0tko8)

Dependencies
============

There is only one dependency that is not included in the Python's
Standard Library which must be installed.

* [pySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide) - pySide is used as the
  user interface framework and must be installed on your system for
  pyTalkmanager to run. pySide can be downloaded from [here]
  (http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:LanguageBindings::PySide::Downloads).
