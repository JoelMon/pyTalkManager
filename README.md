# pyTalkManager

pyTalkManager is a program to aid public talk coordinators in the
congregations of Jehovah's Witness. It is written in
[Python3](https://www.python.org/) and uses the
[Qt](http://qt-project.org/) GUI framework
([PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)) and
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for its database, all of which are
open source and cross platform technologies. Visit the project's
[wiki](https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki) for more
information.

##Development

pyTalkManager is only now starting to be developed. At the moment I am
in the designing phase and do not expect to have pyTalkManager ready
for quite some time. Check back every few weeks to keep an eye on the
progress.
