# pyTalkManager

pyTalkManager is a program to aid public talk coordinators in the
congregations of Jehovah's Witness. It is written in
[Python3](https://www.python.org/) and uses the
[Qt](http://qt-project.org/) GUI framework
([PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)) and
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for its database, all of which are
open source and cross platform technologies. Visit the project's
[wiki](https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki) for more
information.

##Development

pyTalkManager is only now starting to be developed. At the moment I am
in the designing phase and do not expect to have pyTalkManager ready
for quite some time. Check back every few weeks to keep an eye on the
progress.


##Installation

Visit the
[installation section](https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki/installation)
in our wiki for installation instructions.


##Open Source

pyTalkManager is being developed under an free software model. I would
like to take the time to explain what exactly does that means and how
it benefits you as a user.


###Open Source and Free Software

Computer applications are made with something called a *source
code*. The source code are the written instructions the application
uses to run on your computer. An analogy can be made with baking. If a
cake were to be baked, the baker would have to follow a set of
instructions, a recipe, in order to arrive at the end product, a
delicious cake. It can be said that the *recipe* is the cake's source
code.

Say you loved the cake but you had a few ideas to improve upon on it,
say you want to add raisins, or perhaps bake a smaller version of the
cake to fit in your lunch box. Maybe you are allergic to nuts and need
to know if the cake contains nuts. Well, if the baker keeps his recipe
secret then you are unable to bake the cake your self or check how it
was made.

[Open source software](http://opensource.org/)/[Free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
refers to software in which its source code, or *recipe*, is made
public for anyone to view. Also, anyone has the right to download the
source code and make or modify the application. Perhaps you would like
to add a new feature or fix a bug. These are all properties of a open
and free model.


###Benefits

Using an open source model has many benefits to the project and also
to you, the end user.


####The Project

It allows many people to take a part in pyTalkManager's development by
using an open source model. Perhaps one person can help by fixing a
bug in the software, another person may help in the design of the GUI,
Graphical User Interface, while someone else may assist with improving
the database used by pyTalkManager.

The responsibility to build and maintain the project doesn't fall on
the shoulders of one or two individuals. By having many eyes reviewing
and contributing to the project we can all have a hand in the building
of pyTalkManager.


####The End-User (You)

The benefits of using an open source model isn't only for the project
but for its users as well.

More often than not, when you use closed source software, your data
gets locked into the program you are using. For example, say you use a
popular Talk Manager for your congregation but then would like to
migrate the data to another program. You will not be able to because
the author of said program hasn't disclosed how the data is
stored. Further more, the data may not be user accessible.

With open software everything is documented. Data is not stored in a
way that locks it into the application.

Also, say you have a feature that you would like to see implemented
but the developer of the project doesn't know how or doesn't want to
spend the time in implementing it. In an open source project, anyone
can implement your feature without relaying on the project's
manager(s) having to do the work. This means the open source project
have the penitential of gaining features faster than closed sourced
projects.

It is also important to consider the fact that the developers of a
project disappear and stop developing the program. In an open source
project if that were to happen, anyone can take the source code and
continue to develop the project under a new name. This is called
forking.
