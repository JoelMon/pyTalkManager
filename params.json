{"name":"pyTalkManager","tagline":"Software to aid public talk coordinators in the congregations of Jehovah's Witness.","body":"pyTalkManager\r\n=============\r\n\r\npyTalkManager is a program to aid public talk coordinators in the\r\ncongregations of Jehovah's Witness. It is written in\r\n[Python3](https://www.python.org/) and uses the\r\n[Qt](http://qt-project.org/) GUI framework\r\n([PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)) and\r\n[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for its database, all of which are\r\nopen source and cross platform technologies. Visit the project's\r\n[wiki](https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki) for more\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n\r\npyTalkManager is only now starting to be developed. At the moment I am\r\nin the designing phase and do not expect to have pyTalkManager ready\r\nfor quite some time. Check back every few weeks to keep an eye on the\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nOpen Source\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nI have decided to create pyTalkManager as an open source project. By\r\nusing an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)\r\nmodel, features and bug fixes can be submitted by anyone who is\r\nwilling to help. Furthermore, if the project becomes stagnate, others\r\nmay take the source code of pyTalkManager and continue its\r\ndevelopment. This is in stark contrast to how programs for talk\r\ncoordinators have been developed in the past and it is my opinion that\r\ndeveloping these important programs with an open source model is both\r\nproductive and beneficial for the end user.\r\n\r\nNot sure what open source software means? The following video gives a\r\nbasic overview of the open source\r\nmodel. [Open Source Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyd0FO0tko8)\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThere is only one dependency that is not included in the Python's\r\nStandard Library which must be installed.\r\n\r\n* [pySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide) - pySide is used as the\r\n  user interface framework and must be installed on your system for\r\n  pyTalkmanager to run. pySide can be downloaded from [here]\r\n  (http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:LanguageBindings::PySide::Downloads).\r\n\r\n\r\nNote\r\n----\r\n\r\npyTalkManager is not affiliated with the [Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania](http://www.JW.org).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
