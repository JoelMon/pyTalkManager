{"name":"pyTalkManager","tagline":"Software to aid public talk coordinators in the congregations of Jehovah's Witness.","body":"pyTalkManager\r\n=============\r\n\r\npyTalkManager is a program to aid public talk coordinators in the\r\ncongregations of Jehovah's Witness. It is written in Python3 and uses\r\nthe QT GUI framework (PySide) and SQLite, all of which is open source\r\ntechnologies.\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n===========\r\n\r\npyTalkManager is only starting to be developed. At the moment I am\r\nin the designing phase and do not expect to have pyTalkManager ready\r\nfor quite some time. You should check back every few months to keep an\r\neye on its progress if the project interests you.\r\n\r\nOpen Source\r\n===========\r\n\r\nI have decided to create pyTalkManager as an open source project. By\r\nusing an open source model, features and bug fixes can be submitted by anyone\r\nwho is willing to help. Furthermore, if the project becomes stagnate,\r\nothers may take the source code of pyTalkManager and continue its\r\ndevelopment. This is in stark contrast to how programs for talk\r\ncoordinators have been developed in the past and it is my opinion that developing\r\nthese important programs with a open source model is both more\r\nproductive and beneficial for the end user.\r\n\r\nNot sure what open source software means? The following video gives a basic\r\noverview of how open source software\r\nworks. [Open Source Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyd0FO0tko8)\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\n\r\nThere is only one dependency that is not included in the Python3.x\r\nStandard Library which must be installed.\r\n\r\n* [pySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide) - pySide is used as the\r\n  user interface framework and must be installed on your system for\r\n  pyTalkmanager to run. pySide can be downloaded from [here]\r\n  (http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:LanguageBindings::PySide::Downloads).\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Information\r\n================\r\n\r\nReference the project's\r\n[wiki](https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki) for more\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n====\r\n\r\npyTalkManager is not affiliated with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
