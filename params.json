{"name":"pyTalkManager","tagline":"Software to aid public talk coordinators in the congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses.","body":"# pyTalkManager\r\n\r\n**pyTalkManager** is a program to aid public talk coordinators, PTC,\r\nin the congregations of Jehovah's Witness. It is written in\r\n[Python3](https://www.python.org/) and uses the\r\n[Qt](http://qt-project.org/) GUI framework\r\n([PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)) * and\r\n[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for its database, all of which are\r\nopen source and cross platform technologies. Visit the project's\r\n[wiki](https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki) for more\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n**pyTalkManager** differentiates its self from other PTC software in a\r\nnumber of ways. For one, it is an open source project. Also,\r\n**pyTalkManager** will not be sold or have features that can only be\r\nunlocked with *donations*. Since **pyTalkManager** is open source and\r\nuses the GPL v.3 license, other PTC software developers can create\r\nprograms that interact with **pyTalkManager**. \r\n\r\n\\* - Due to PySide not being developed any longer, the Qt Python binding\r\nwill be migrated to PyQt4. \r\n\r\n##Development\r\n\r\n**pyTalkManager** is being actively developed and is still in its early\r\nstages. Check back every few weeks to keep an eye on the progress.\r\n\r\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nVisit the\r\n[installation section](https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki/installation)\r\nin our wiki for installation instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Screenshots\r\n![Screenshot of the main window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/images/sreenshots/MainWindow_2014-11-26.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of the Congregation Edit Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/images/sreenshots/EditCongregation_2014-11-27.png)\r\nNote: The screenshots above are out of date.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\n**pyTalkManager** is released under the\r\n[GPL v.3 license](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n##Note\r\n\r\n**pyTalkManager** is not affiliated with the\r\n[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania](http://www.JW.org).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
