{"name":"pyTalkManager","tagline":"Software to aid public talk coordinators in the congregations of Jehovah's Witness.","body":"# pyTalkManager\r\n\r\npyTalkManager is a program to aid public talk coordinators in the\r\ncongregations of Jehovah's Witness. It is written in\r\n[Python3](https://www.python.org/) and uses the\r\n[Qt](http://qt-project.org/) GUI framework\r\n([PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)) and\r\n[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for its database, all of which are\r\nopen source and cross platform technologies. Visit the project's\r\n[wiki](https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager/wiki) for more\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n##Development\r\n\r\npyTalkManager is only now starting to be developed. At the moment I am\r\nin the designing phase and do not expect to have pyTalkManager ready\r\nfor quite some time. Check back every few weeks to keep an eye on the\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\npyTalkManager is still in its early stages of development. It is not\r\nrecommended for you to download and try to run pyTalkManager.\r\n\r\npyTalkManager will be compiled for Windows and packaged for Linux and\r\nMac OS X for easy installation once pyTalkManager v.1.0 is released.\r\n\r\nIf you are still curious and want to install pyTalkManager as it is\r\nbeing developed then you can follow the instructions in this section\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n###Windows\r\n\r\nAt the moment it requires a bit of effort to run pyTalkManager in its\r\ncurrent state on Windows. \r\n\r\nDownload the source files for pyTalkManager from the\r\n[pyTalkManager website](https://theodevelopers.github.io/pyTalkManager/)\r\nand decompress the file.\r\n\r\nIn order to install pyTalkManager you will have to have\r\n[Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your\r\nsystem. Once Python is installed, you must adjust your system\r\nvariables so that that you may run the `python` interpreter without\r\nhaving to `cd` into the Python installed directory. Instructions for\r\nsetting system variables can be found in the\r\n[Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.4/using/windows.html).\r\n\r\nOnce Python3 is installed, you must install the\r\n[PySide framework](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide_Binaries_Windows).\r\n\r\nOnce everything is installed correctly, open your terminal and `cd`\r\ninsto the directory containing the source files you downloaded from\r\nthis repository. Run the command `python main.py` and pyTalkManager\r\nwill run.\r\n\r\n###Linux/GNU\r\n\r\nDownload the source files for pyTalkManager from the\r\n[pyTalkManager website](https://theodevelopers.github.io/pyTalkManager/)\r\nand decompress the file. main.py is the main script for pyTalkManager.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have Python3 and PySide installed.\r\n\r\n####Debian\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install python3 && sudo apt-get install python3-pyside`\r\n\r\nOnce that is installed, run `python3 main.py` and pyTalkManager will run. \r\n\r\n##Dependencies\r\n\r\nThere is only one dependency that is not included in the Python's\r\nStandard Library which must be installed.\r\n\r\n* [pySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide) - pySide is used as the\r\n  user interface framework and must be installed on your system for\r\n  pyTalkmanager to run. pySide can be downloaded from [here]\r\n  (http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:LanguageBindings::PySide::Downloads).\r\n\r\n##Open Source\r\n\r\nI have decided to create pyTalkManager as an open source project. By\r\nusing an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)\r\nmodel, features and bug fixes can be submitted by anyone who is\r\nwilling to help. Furthermore, if the project becomes stagnate, others\r\nmay take the source code of pyTalkManager and continue its\r\ndevelopment. This is in stark contrast to how programs for talk\r\ncoordinators have been developed in the past and it is my opinion that\r\ndeveloping these important programs with an open source model is both\r\nproductive and beneficial for the end user.\r\n\r\nNot sure what open source software means? The following video gives a\r\nbasic overview of the open source\r\nmodel.
