pyTalkManager 
============= 

pyTalkManager is a program to aid public talk coordinators in the
congregations of Jehovah Witness.  it is written in Python3 and uses
the QT GUI framework (PySide) and SQLite, all of which is open source
technologies.

Development
===========

pyTalkManager is only starting to be developed. At the moment I am
in the designing phase and do not expect to have pyTalkManager ready
for quite some time. You should check back every few months to keep an
eye on its progress if the project interests you.

Open Source
===========

I have decided to create pyTalkManager as an open source project. By
using an open source model, features and bug fixes can be submitted by anyone
who is willing to help. Furthermore, if the project becomes stagnate,
others may take the source code of pyTalkManager and continue its
development. This is in stark contrast to how programs for talk
coordinators have been developed and it's my opinion that developing
these important programs with a closed sourced model is not the most
productive or helpful model for the end user.
